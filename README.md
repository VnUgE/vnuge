### Motivations
- Performance - I like my stuff fast, as fast as possible 
- Self hosted - I care about empowering DIY and a decentralized internet.
- Open source - I want to verify and understand what code is being executed.
- Internet privacy - Just because your trunk is locked you shouldn't be forced to open it.  
- OSS security - modern application security features should not be restricted to enterprise software.
- General Home Lab - While an expensive hobby, I like that I only need to rely on myself, my ISPs, and electricity to share my work and my voice with the online world.
### Other interests and hobbies
- Automotive - The past 7 years have been spent professionally in the automotive performance field. My specialty was in diesel engine calibration engineering.
- Home server lab - With self hosting comes a "datacenter" to support it. I enjoy building enterprise-ish networking/hosting solutions 
- Home electronics lab - I often like tinkering with small electronics and designing PCBs as well as collecting professional lab equipment. I still need a decent logic analyzer if you have one!)
